This is the main [Diagnosticator](https://diangosticator.com) application

You have different ways to deploy this, as explained [here](https://diagnosticator.com/development_installation)

You can easily set up the whole application with a single-line command through docker-compose: [instructions](https://diagnosticator.com/installation)

Or you can deploy it through [Docker](https://diagnosticator.com/development_installation_docker) or [Flask](https://diagnosticator.com/development_installation_flask)
